## Tech stack
- HTML

## Project

The project task was to create a responsive website using the mobe first approach. It should include a header, one big news article (hero section) and some extra smaller new articles arrange in different columns or rows depeneding on the screen size. The goal was to practice using the layout techniques like Grid and Flexbox. 

I started by designing my inital idea in Figma, deciding on placement of different sections and figures as well as color choices. I designed the page first for mobile and then went on to think about how I would change the layout for a larger screen. 
I then went on to coding first the skeleton of the website with HTML. Creating a header, main and footer section. In the header, I wanted to have a logo and a navigation menue that would turn into a hamburger-menue for the mobile version. The main part of the website I divided into multiple sections for the big news article, the medium size news articles and the small ones. In the footer I wanted to have the logo as well as a link to my GitHub. I then went on to style the website using CSS. Using the mobile first principle, I used flexbox to place the different elements in each section into columns and played around by having subelements within a section in a row format. I then used media queries to ensure a responsive design when the website is viewed on larger devices. Here I used grid in the hero section to adjust the placement of the image and the text. When every part was in place, I wanted to add some hover effects using CSS for the images and logos.

Improvement goals: making the hamburger-menue on the mobile version functional using purely CSS.
