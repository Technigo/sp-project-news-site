# News Site

Description of the assignment: create a responsive news-site using flexbox and css grid. 

Approach:
Inspiration: Iâ€™ve been craving tacos for the past couple of weeks, so I chose to make my webpage focused on taco-related content.
Planning: I started by sketching the design on paper and outlining the HTML elements and CSS classes I planned to use. This plan evolved as I began coding.

Implementation:
Structure: I focused on building the structure, starting with the header, navigation bar, main sections (including top news and other articles), and a footer. Links and images were added after finalizing the structure.

Layout: My initial plan was to use CSS Grid for the overall layout and Flexbox for positioning. However, I ended up using Flexbox for the header and Grid for the rest of the page. I took inspiration from other news sites using browser inspection tools, which helped me a lot.

Styling: Once the layout was complete, I added images, links, and custom fonts to enhance the site's appearance. I also implemented hover effects on the taco button and links.

Hamburger Menu: For mobile responsiveness, I added a hamburger menu with a toggler to replace the nav bar when the webpage is in mobile mode. I googled a solution to do this without using JavaScript.

Responsiveness: The site was designed to be responsive across devices, with "custom" breakpoints to ensure it looks good on screens ranging from 320px to 1600px.

- If you had more time, what would be next?

- I would have liked to create a custom logo.
- i would have likes to add some subpages to link the navigation-bar
- I also would have liked to make the images uniform in size.
I would have liked the font size to be more responsive, adjusting more smoothly between small screens and larger ones, so it wouldn't appear too small in mobile mode.
-  I struggled with the responsiveness and media queries, With more time, I would have liked to ajust the media queries for more precise breakpoints and better responsiveness.
